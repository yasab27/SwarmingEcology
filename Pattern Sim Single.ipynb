    "## Uniform Optimal Pattern Simulator\n",
    "#### Author: Yasa Baig\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we generate a python implementation of Luo et. al (2020)'s paper on coarse-grained optimal bacterial growth simulator. Unlike mechanistic RD models, this system operates by assuming that whatever geometry is generated by numerics is simply the one which maximizes global population biomass accumulation. This is done in practice by running a mixed agent-based, PDE simulation where the diffusion of nutrients is handled via a PDE but the actual growth of the colony is done through an agent based method where individual \"tips\" of branches are tracked and grow (i.e. move in space) and subdivide according to some fixed rules in the system.

    "### Modeling Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "We now will consider actually simulating the system. Our hybrid PDE-agent based model evolves according to the following steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we model nutrients undergoing diffusion in space and consumption by cells. This is given by the simple reaction-diffusion equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{\\partial N}{\\partial t} = D_N \\, \\nabla^2 N - \\beta_N \\, f_g(\\boldsymbol{x})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $D_N$ is the diffusion constant of the nutrient (for small molecules on order of 2000 to 200 $\\mu m/s^2$, $\\beta$ is the uptake rate and $f_g$ corresponds to a consumption function for the cells and varies in space depending on local cell density concentration. The nutrient obeys no flux conditions. \n",
    "Next we consider the growth of cells throughout the pattern. We operate under the simplifying assumption that the diffusion of biomass throughout the entire colony is very fast relative to consumption and that biomass is allocated uniformly (for now) throughout the pattern. Thus we treat biomass purely as a scalar quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{d C}{dt} = \\dfrac{\\int_{\\Omega} \\, \\alpha_c \\, f_g(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\, d\\boldsymbol{x}  }{\\int_{\\Omega} \\, d\\boldsymbol{x} }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the biomass is computed by taking the integral of nutrient consumption over the entire space and then distributing equally over the entire volume, leading to a scalar cell density. This treats the explicitly continuous part of the model. Next we need to consider the agent based component of this model, which is more nontrivial. For each individual branch we compute the extension (i.e. $\\partial_t L_i$ or numerically $\\Delta r_i$). This leads to extension given by:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\gamma$ is the expansion efficiency, a mechanical constant, and $W_i$ is the width of a given branch. $\\alpha$ in turn controls the relative energy translation effiency from nutrient uptake in the system. The $n$ here corresponds to the number of branches (agents) which overlap at a given location in space. The integral is taken over the branch $\\Omega_i$. Lastly we need to define this ever important consumption function, which is given by simple Michealis-Menton kinetics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_G(x,y) =\\frac{N(x,y)}{N(x,y)+K_N} \\frac{C_m}{C(x,y)+C_m} C(x,y)\n",

    "We define the kinetic constants (estimated from pure liquid culture experiment) below. \n",

On the right hand side, similarly we have all the variables assocated to the current time point.
